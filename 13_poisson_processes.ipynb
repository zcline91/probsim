    "In Chapter 5, we discussed how to simulate a specified number of arrivals from a one-dimensional Poisson process by using the fact that the interarrival times are i.i.d. Exponentials. In this chapter, Story 13.2.4 tells us how to simulate a Poisson process within a specified interval $(0,L]$. We first generate the number of arrivals $N(L)$, which is distributed $\\text{Pois}(\\lambda L)$. Conditional on $N(L) =n$, the arrival times are distributed as the order statistics of $n$ i.i.d. $\\text{Unif}(0,L)$ r.v.s. The following code simulates arrivals from a Poisson process with rate $10$ in the interval $(0,5]$:"

    "It is straightforward to thin a Poisson process in R. The following code starts with a vector of arrival times $\\mathbf t$ and the corresponding number of arrivals $n$ from a Poisson process of rate $\\lambda$ on some interval, generated as above. For each arrival, we flip a coin with probability $p$ of Heads; these coin tosses are stored in the vector $\\mathbf y$. Finally, the arrivals for which the coin landed Heads are labeled as type-$1$; the rest are labeled as type-$2$. The resulting vectors of arrival times, $\\mathbf t_1$ and $\\mathbf t_2$, are realizations of independent Poisson processes of rates $\\lambda p$ and $\\lambda (1âˆ’p)$, by Theorem 13.2.14.\n"
