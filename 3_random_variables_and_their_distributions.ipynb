Typing `help(distributions)` gives a handy list of built-in distributions; many others are available through R packages that can be loaded."

    "- `dbinom` is the Binomial PMF. It takes three inputs: the first is the value of $x$ at which to evaluate the PMF, and the second and third are the parameters $n$ and $p$. For example, `dbinom(3,5,0.2)` returns the probability $P(X= 3)$ where $X \\sim \\text{Bin}(5,0.2)$. In other words, $$\\texttt{dbinom(3,5,0.2)} = \\binom 5 3 (0.2)^3(0.8)^2 = 0.0512.$$\n",
    "- `pbinom` is the Binomial CDF. It takes three inputs: the first is the value of $x$ at which to evaluate the CDF, and the second and third are the parameters. `pbinom(3,5,0.2)` is the probability $P(X \\leq 3)$ where $X \\sim \\text{Bin}(5,0.2)$. So $$\\texttt{pbinom(3,5,0.2)} = \\sum_{k=0}^3 \\binom 5 k (0.2)^k (0.8)^{5âˆ’k} = 0.9933.$$\n",
    "- `rbinom` is a function for generating Binomial random variables. For `rbinom`, the first input is how many r.v.s we want to generate, and the second and third inputs are still the parameters. Thus the command `rbinom(7,5,0.2)` produces realizations of seven i.i.d. $\\text{Bin}(5,0.2)$ r.v.s. When we ran this command, we got `2 1 0 0 1 0 0` but you'll probably get something different when you try it!"
