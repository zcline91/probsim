Online resources can teach you how to install packages in R for your system, but for many systems an easy way is to use the `install.packages` command, e.g., by typing `install.packages(\"mvtnorm\")` to install the `mvtnorm` package. After installing it, load the package with `library(mvtnorm)`. Then `dmvnorm` can be used for calculating the joint PDF, and `rmvnorm` can be used for generating random vectors. For example, suppose that we want to generate 1000 independent Bivariate Normal pairs $(Z,W)$, with correlation $\\rho = 0.7$ and $\\mathcal N(0,1)$ marginals.
